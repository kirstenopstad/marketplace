## Description

### Objectives

Create a website that sells a specific product. 
* Create a form that allows buyers to 
  * Select a product to purchase. If your online marketplace sells jewelry, include form fields denoting whether they're ordering a bracelet, necklace, or earrings. 
  * Take in the buyer's shipping and payment information

When the buyer submits the form, use branching to add a discount to the order based on what the user has selected to purchase. You can make this as complicated or as simple as you like.

Then, display a receipt with all of the order information back to the user, including the discounted price.

As you code, make sure to use the debugging tools you have learned about in this course section.

Once your application is functioning correctly, try to refactor your code as much as possible to make your code easy to understand and read, and so that your UI and business logic is separated.

Add CSS to your online store to make it look more professional or inviting. Or add a stylistic theme that matches whatever your store is selling.
